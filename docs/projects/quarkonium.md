# Quarkonium
`A CYBERSPACE CONSTITUTION`

Quarkonium constructs a constitutional cyberspace system on an unstoppable distributed ledger network.

## Introduction

This project builds a digital ecosystem running on a blockchain, a decentralized distributed ledger. Applications in the ecosystem are native or compatible to interact with the blockchain. Developers are able to start and/or join Quarkonium flexibly with some built-in tools provided by the ecosystem emulators.

The aim of the project is to create a prototype of cyberspace federal system, and expand the ecosystem by natural growth and uniting cyber communities.

### Infrastructure: A Perpetual Ledger
Quarkonium Foundation works with the communities to launch a public blockchain, as the system infrastructure, with the open source genesis.

### Constitution: A Stakeless Consensus
Quarkonium Foundation proposes a consensus mechanism of stakelessness (sortition) for a federal system to run the backbone of the infrastructure.

### System Facilities: Digital Emulators
Quarkonium Foundation co-builds a digital asset emulator and a decentralized application emulator, etc. with the communities to invent and explore the Quarkonium cryptonomic system.


## Miscellaneous

Project collaboration extends from teamwork, coalition, partnership, etc. to spontaneous cooperation among virtual units.

### Quarkonium Foundation
Quarkonium Foundation pioneers the development of the core systems, organizes the ecosystem communications, maintains the collaboration among communities, approves and supports any significant roadmap.
