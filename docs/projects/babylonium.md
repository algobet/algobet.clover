# Babylonium
`A CYBERSPACE INSTITUTION`

Babylonium constructs an institutional cyberspace system on the top of a public ledger or blockchain with a sustainable and self-adaptive mechanism of consensus.

## Introduction

This project builds decentralized applications (Dapps) running on the top of a public ledger. Deeply integrated into with the ledger, Babylonium also develops a cluster of instititutional facilities to bridge Dapps to the blockchain. Developers are able to take part in the open source [Babylonium communities](https://github.com/babylonium/) to use built-in tools.

The aim of the project is to seed a democratic institution to co-build a constitutional cyberspace, along with disruptive technologies like web 3.0, blockchain, cryptonomics, etc.

### Infrastructure: A Public Ledger
Babylonium Foundation works with the communities to initiate a public ledger as the system infrastructure to back the development of institutional facilities and Dapps.

### Constitution: The Quarkonium
Babylonium Foundation adopts the 'Quarkonium' stakeless consensus mechanism to constitute system-wide protocols and start up the infrastructural backbone.

### Institution: A Federal System
Babylonium Foundation initiates a prototype of federal cyberspace institution. Built on the labeled public ledger, engines of Dapps and protocols are the native components of the Bablylonium institution.

### Protocols and Dapps
Prototype | Implementation
--- | ---
Protocol | BIX - Blockchain Information Exchange
Dapp     | BAO - Blockchain Asset Omnificence

## Miscellaneous

Project collaboration extends from teamwork, coalition, partnership, etc. to spontaneous cooperation among virtual units.

### Babylonium Foundation
Babylonium Foundation pioneers the development of the core systems, organizes the ecosystem communications, maintains the collaboration among communities, approves and supports any significant roadmap.
